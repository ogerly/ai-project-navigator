# AI Project Navigator Backend Structure

## Overview

The backend of the AI Project Navigator is designed to handle the server-side logic, data processing, and API endpoints for the application. It is built using Node.js with Express.js and integrates with MongoDB for data storage. Additionally, Python-based microservices are used for AI and machine learning functionalities.
